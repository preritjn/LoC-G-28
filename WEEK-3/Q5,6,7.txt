Q7- The size of a C structure is determined by the total size of its individual members, along with 
    any padding that the compiler may add to ensure proper memory alignment. To calculate the size
    of a C structure, we add up the sizes of its members and also the padding in them.
    The size of a C structure can be calculated using the sizeof operator.
